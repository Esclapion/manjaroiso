Configs for [manjaroiso] (https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=ManjaroISO) for the [OpenRC edition] (https://forum.manjaro.org/index.php?topic=16177.0).

An ISO can be built by downloading a copy of these configs, and running
<pre>sudo buildiso</pre>
in the net-openrc or ob-openrc folder (manjaroiso needs to be installed).

ISOs built using these configs can be found at [sourceforge] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mefiles/files/Manjaro/).
